# Step 1: Install required packages (if not already installed)
# pip install pandas requests

# Step 2: Set up basic structure
import requests
import pandas as pd

# Step 3: Define API request
# Replace with a real weather API if you have one
# Example: https://www.weatherapi.com/, https://open-meteo.com/

# Step 4: Extract data from API
# Step 5: Normalize/clean the data
# Step 6: Save to CSV or SQLite
# Step 7: Optional: Load and analyze recent weather trends

# Each step can be developed incrementally.
