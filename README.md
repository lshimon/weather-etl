# Weather ETL Project

## Goal
Build a simple data pipeline that:
- Fetches weather data from an API
- Cleans and transforms it
- Saves the results locally (CSV or SQLite)
- Optionally analyzes or visualizes recent weather patterns

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- Requests
- SQLite (optional)

## Learning Focus
- Practice basic ETL structure
- Learn API requests, data cleaning, saving data
- Build real, usable code to show progress
