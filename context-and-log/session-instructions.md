# Session Learning Instructions

## Learning Approach
1. **Teach concepts first** - don't just give code
2. **Always respond in English** - even if user writes Hebrew  
3. **I lead the learning** - decide the pace and approach
4. **Focus on WHY before HOW**
5. **Teach WITH code** - show code and explain what and how we're using each part

## Current Session Goal
- 25-minute learning session on ETL Scheduling (Step 5)
- Focus: Understanding and implementing automated scheduling for weather ETL pipeline

# Session Instructions – Weather ETL (Transition Project)

## 🧭 Context:
This project is part of a structured career transition from **QA Engineer → Data Engineer**.

I (the developer) am working through a personal learning system that includes:
- A central roadmap
- A structured Google Sheet tracker (with multiple tabs)
- A consistent method for how to run and close each session

This Weather ETL repo is **one of those projects** — and follows the same rules.

---

## 🟢 Start of Session:
1. Open `tracker.csv` in this folder.
2. Look for the first task where `Status` is not ✅ Done.
3. Work on that task and nothing else.

> Every task here was originally defined inside a broader roadmap  
> stored in my **Data Engineering Tracker** spreadsheet (Google Sheets).

If something feels unclear, assume:
- This is part of a larger ETL skill-building progression
- Tasks must be completed one by one (no jumping ahead)
- You can ask me (the human) if you hit a wall

---

## 🧠 During the Session:
- Work on just one task.
- As you go, update `tracker.csv`:
  - `Status` → 🟡 In Progress or ✅ Done
  - `Date Started`, `Date Done`
  - `Notes`, `Learned` (as needed)

---

## 🟣 End of Session:
1. Mark the row as ✅ Done (if completed)
2. Fill in notes, and what was learned
3. (Optional) Add a reflection to my long-term log:
   → Located in another repo: `Learning-system/tracker-log.csv`

---

## 🔁 Weekly Sync with Google Sheet:
- Once a week, I open this file (`tracker.csv`) in Excel
- Copy everything
- Paste it into the **Weather ETL** tab inside my Google Sheet

This keeps my system synced without forcing real-time connection.

---

## 🧩 About this Repo:
- This repo is **self-contained**: it tracks just this one project
- Cursor has no access to my wider system, so follow only what's here

---

## ✅ Summary:
- Do only one task at a time
- Always update `tracker.csv`
- This project is part of a bigger structured learning system — you're inside it now

No stress — just make progress, step by step.
