# CONTEXT: QA to Data Engineer Journey

## About Me
- Transitioning from manual QA to data engineering
- Learn best by doing, not by long reading
- Father of 5 with full-time job, often learning late at night
- ADHD: Need practical, short steps and low-pressure learning

## Strategy
- Focus on 1 real project at a time
- Learn just-in-time while building (not everything upfront)
- Use Cursor as daily helper, and ChatGPT as weekly planner

## Current Project
**Weather ETL**
- Goal: Build a small data pipeline to fetch, clean, store, and analyze daily weather data
- Tools: Python, Pandas, API requests, basic CSV or SQLite
- Outcome: Practice data engineering basics in a visible, useful, and buildable way

## Next Steps
- Ask Cursor: “What should I do next in this project?”
- Or tell it: “I want to practice transforming the weather data. Can you guide me?”
